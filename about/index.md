Hello Everyone!
<br    />
My name is Yingzi (Sandy) XU and I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Statistics at North Carolina State University](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/). I work with Dr. Howard Bondell on new classification methods. Before moving to North Carolina, I grew up in [Hangzhou](http://eng.hangzhou.gov.cn/), China.
I  completed my undergraduate studies at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with major in Applied Biology and minor in Finance.
