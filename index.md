Hello Everyone!
<br    />
<br    />
My name is Yingzi (Sandy) XU and I am currently a Ph.D. student in [_Statistics at North Carolina State University_](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/). I work with [_Dr. Howard Bondell_](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~hdbondel/) on new classification methods. Before moving to North Carolina, I grew up in [_Hangzhou_](http://eng.hangzhou.gov.cn/), China and graduated from [_Zhejiang University_](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2012 with  Bachelor's degrees in Applied Biological Science and Finance.
