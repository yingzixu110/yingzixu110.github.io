Hello Everyone!
<br    />
<br    />
My name is Yingzi (Sandy) XU and I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Statistics at North Carolina State University](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/). I work with [Dr. Howard Bondell](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~hdbondel/) on new classification methods. Before moving to North Carolina, I grew up in [Hangzhou](http://eng.hangzhou.gov.cn/), China and graduated from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2012 with  Bachelor's degrees in Applied Biological Science and Finance.
