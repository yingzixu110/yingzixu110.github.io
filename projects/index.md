#### Spatial Study of Gasoline Price Trend in United States
- Discovered the price trend and pattern difference of seven regions in U.S.

- Implemented time series model and  spatial panal model to predict the future gas price 

- Poster available [_here_](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~yxu15/spatial_poster.pdf)


#### Recommender System for Yelp Business Rating Prediction
- Implemented different recommendation system models such as collaborative filtering model to predict the future ratings of business given by specific users given a detailed snapshot of Yelp data

- Achieved root mean squared error (RMSE) 6.5% better than the overall average benchmark with a blended model

- Report available [_here_](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~yxu15/yelp_report.pdf)


#### Click-through Rate Prediction of Online Advertisements
- Implemented multivariate linear regression models and logistic regression models to predict the click- through rate of ads based on 16 million records of user information

- Achieved a prediction accuracy 19.4% better than the benchmark based on ROC curve

- Report available [_here_](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~yxu15/click_report.pdf)

#### Top 10 Articles in Wikipedia via Hadoop Map/Reduce
- Explored a 41GB of XML text file in Wiki markup language to get the top 10 popular articles by implementing map/reduce scripts in Python


#### A Bayesian Approach to Compare Survival Rate of Bone Marrow Transplant Methods
- Analyzed bone marrow transplant survival data using a Bayesian Cox Proportional Hazards Model

- Developed both parametric and semi-parametric models to approximate the baseline hazards

- Compared the effectiveness of the two methods using Monte Carlo methods

#### Longitudinal Study of Different Tillage Treatments Effect on Soil Moisture

- Analyzed soil moisture trend profiles over time for each of the six tillage treatment groups

- Discovered appropriate covariance models and corresponding correlation models between different time points

- Developed a generalized additive models to compare the effect of different tillage treatmens

- Slides available [_here_](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~yxu15/soil_slides.pdf)


#### Longitudinal Study of the African American English Development
- Developed longitudinal models to examine the evolution of the African American English vernacular, while accounting for time dependent / independent covariates in both population level and individual level

- Investigated variance structure of repeated measurements, completed population level model, random coeffient model, linear mixed model and generalized linear mixed model

- Report available [_here_](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~yxu15/aae_report.pdf)



#### Influence of Incentive Plans to Credit Card Consumption
